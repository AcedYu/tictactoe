# TicTacToe
This is a single page application based purely on javascript logic.
This program displays a two player tic-tac-toe game. Each player can alternately put Xs and Os in each of the compartments of the 3x3 figure in order to try to fulfil the win condition of getting 3 of their respective symbols in a row.

I implement some logical algorithms such as:
- Determining if the board state contains a win condition
- Determining the turn player at any point in the game
- Determining the winner of the game upon completion
- Rendering a reset of the game after a completed game
